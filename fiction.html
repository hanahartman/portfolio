	        <p>A tattoo artist named Candace is also a book of the same name. She is the story of her own life, and as such her work will likely be published posthumously. Unlike most people, who are content to allow time to turn them into documents, etching lines on their faces, scars on their bodies, weariness or contentment in their souls, Candace speeds up the process by doing it herself. When something particularly wonderful or traumatic happens to her, she tattoos it onto her belly, where such things typically reside. Whenever she completes an important journey, she tattoos it onto her feet. As she ages, she tattoos wrinkles onto her forehead, so that the world will know she has worried or laughed, has existed for long enough for her skin to get tired of holding itself up. When she falls in love, she tattoos it onto her heart, and when she conquers a problem, she tattoos it onto her biceps. Eventually she will be covered entirely in bits of her own story. She will look like an amalgamation of all the things that have ever happened to her—in short, she will look exactly like everybody else.</p>

	        <p>Before Brandon met his grandfather for the first time, his father took him shopping for golf shoes. They went to a store that sold children’s athletic shoes in the icily air-conditioned Silver Brook Mall, which, as far as Brandon knew, wasn’t anywhere near a brook, let alone a silver one, but his father said that was beside the point. Brandon sat on the backless wooden benches and kicked his feet while his father talked to the salesperson, and then he walked around in the smooth, funny-feeling shoes while they asked him questions and pressed down on his toes. Finally his father picked a black-and-beige pair, paid, and they walked together across the hot asphalt parking lot to the car.</p>
	        <p>Brandon sat in the passenger seat with the new pair of golf shoes in their box on his lap. His father was being very quiet, but Brandon knew he wasn’t mad because he had let him sit in the front seat, even though the label above the mirror on the sun visor warned that AIRBAGS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH TO CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE. Brandon was only seven, so his mother thought it was too dangerous for him to sit up front, but his father always let him unless he was in trouble.</p>
	        <p>“Daddy?” he finally ventured. “Do you like Grandpa?”</p>

	        <p>The doorbell rang and rang and rang. The house filled up slowly like a shirt, stretching and adjusting unevenly to accommodate the bodies inside. Bags hung in closets and boots lined the wall by the front door. Slowly the few voices that had begun to drift down the hallways grew to a rumble of chatter and wine and the high static of a too-old TV wearily moving its pixels into the shape of a football game. It was Thanksgiving Day.</p>
	        <p>In the kitchen, Andrea watched her turkey anxiously as it broiled. It was enormous and her worst fear was that it would take too long to cook, and everyone would be left waiting hours and hours for dinner. “Well why did you get a turkey so big, An?” Richard would say. “There are only ten of us, for Christ’s sake. We don’t need such a big bird.” And then her father-in-law George would make a joke, something like, “What’d you do, get two or three turkeys and mash them together?” and everyone would laugh politely. Andrea fumed as she watched the blade of the mixer relentlessly mashing potatoes.</p>

	        <p>Licorice’s mind was full of faces without names. Over time, she learned thousands of them, probably millions, lined and worn, weather-beaten and smooth, weary and grateful and soft and bitter. They belonged to the dead people, the old men and little babies, the soldiers and mothers and drug addicts and professionals in elevators. She held their hands—all their hands. She watched them die, and learned their faces, and walked away.</p>
	        <p class="break">***</p>
	        <p>Licorice got her name from the first death she ever witnessed. The day was wet, and she was very cold. The empty street was strewn with leaves and shiny from rain, spotted with puddles that filled the pitted sidewalk like puzzle pieces. On the corner, she saw a sign: <i>Licorice Lane.</i></p>
	        <p><i>Licorice,</i> she thought. <i>Licorice. That’s me.</i></p>
	        <p>She turned down the narrow side street and was following it slowly, with no particular destination in mind, when she saw that the door to one of the old brick townhouses along the walk had been left open a crack. A stripe of yellow light was spilling out onto the rain-soaked stoop like hot butter. She was alone on the sidewalk. The dogs and squirrels paid no mind as she walked up the steps of the brownstone and slid inside.</p>

	        <p>The last thing my mother said to me before I took off on my own was spoken through a scratched car window over the blast of the air conditioning. “Don’t forget to separate your whites and colors!” she said, certain that there would be a washing machine wherever I was going, that I would have enough clothes and enough spare change to fill that washing machine twice. I just waved and drove away. The air outside was hot and thick with dust, but I was insulated inside my shell of metal and glass, kept clean and secure by the grind of the engine and the swish of the wipers resolutely rubbing grime and bug guts off the windshield. The wheels hummed against the road below, and I was flying.</p>
	        <p class="break">***</p>
	        <p>The patch of land behind the house I grew up in might have been a lawn once, but by the time I knew it, there was nothing left but a scraggly rectangle of weeds, each of them seemingly hell-bent on sticking thistles and foxtails into every cotton sock they came into contact with. That yard had a remarkable ability to stay relentlessly yellow all summer. After big rainstorms, instead of turning green and healthy, the whole thing would turn into a mess of thick, slippery brown, here and there spotted with puddles floating yellow slime, the weeds buried in newly exposed clay.</p>
	        <p>When that happened, there was nothing I liked better than hunting for snails. My mother would sit on the back porch and smoke a cigarette with the neighbor ladies while I crawled around on my hands and knees, squeezing earth through my fingers until I found a soft invertebrate body wading through the slime.</p>

	        <p>In retrospect, Nina thought that the only reason she had survived her senior year without totally losing her mind was because she had gotten a hobby—watching Armando. They never spoke, not until that very last day, and although Maddy still swore up and down that Nina was just in denial, she didn’t think she had been in love with him either. Even so, she had come to love him in a strange way—the love of tasteless Eggo waffles, the love of bus drivers, the love of all the things you rely on to make your life the way it is. Now that she was in college and far away, Nina still caught herself searching for him sometimes in hallways, looking for his oversized olive green puffer coat and neon orange high-tops, and it always reminded her of how her little sister Angela had cried and cried when their parents finally threw out the old black kitchen chairs, thoroughly scratched and verifiably wobbly for at least the past ten years. Their parents were mystified; they said they had never known that Angela was so attached to the kitchen chairs. Angela said she wasn’t attached to them exactly, it was just that they had always held her up while she ate her cereal, and they wobbled just right.</p>
	        <p>One of Armando’s strange qualities, and the one that first drew Nina’s attention, was the lollipop thing. He seemed to have an endless supply of them, usually that dull purple color indicating grape flavor, but on rare occasions Nina had spotted bright red cherry, and once, a neon yellow that had to be lemon.</p>

	        <p>Deep at the bottom of the sea there is an immortal crab. His name, articulated in clicks and clacks of his crabby claws, is unpronounceable by human mouths and unspellable in any human language, so in order to facilitate easy identification the scientists who research him have named him Harold. They know he is immortal because they have placed a wireless heart monitor inside his crabby chest and it has been broadcasting continuously for the last 70 years. At the time of its implantation researchers estimated that Harold was already more than 20 years old. Interns watch the wireless feed day and night so as to catch any variation in his heartbeat, but thus far not a single tiny disturbance has been observed. The lifespan of an Atlantic Crab is about six months, making Harold’s age more than 180 times that of the next oldest recorded member of his species.</p>
	        <p>The most recent intern to be assigned to Harold’s heart monitor is named Maureen.</p>
